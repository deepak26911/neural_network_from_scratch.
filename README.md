# Neural Network From Scratch

A simple neural network implemented from scratch in Python using NumPy.  
This project demonstrates a basic feedforward neural network with backpropagation and trains it to solve the classic XOR problem.

## Features

- Fully connected 2-layer neural network
- Sigmoid activation function
- Backpropagation implemented from scratch
- Training and prediction on the XOR dataset
- Modular design using a Python class

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepak26911/neural_network_from_scratch.git
